# No Fear Git

A companion repo for the talk I delivered in April 2021 about embracing git,
rather than shrinking from it in fear.

## Slides

The slides for the talk are available on
[Google Slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1QdUyN1d53kqfvXAF8r4NiWYYAdYmtFMZhVGC1FGzW5s/edit?usp=sharing).

## Text

This talk started out as a text file which lays out much of the same
information in more detail. It is available as a
[GitHub Gist](https://gist.github.com/delventhalz/dc4d4ca6d04205e0dcac3c91ca8171e8).

## Feedback

If you discover typos or bugs in the talk or repo, a quick
[GitHub Issue](https://github.com/delventhalz/no-fear-git/issues/new)
is a great way to bring it to my attention.

For any follow up questions, I am known to lurk on
[twitter](https://twitter.com/delventhalz) when I should be doing something
productive with my life.
